/**
 * KPI - Key Performance Indicator
 *
 * Will eventually be a weighted equation that will calculate
 * who is awesome and who sucks.  The resulting value with be a sum of weights
 * based off many different things like....
 * - How many cards they've donated
 * - How many war battles they've missed
 * - How many collection battles they missed
 * - How long they have been away
 * - How many cards they have received vs donated
 * - How long they have been in the clan.
 *
 * All this based off article I found when looking up how to design DB for tracking progress.
